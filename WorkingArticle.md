# WorkingArticle
1% a day is all you need

an app to make and use timed todo list and recepies

## BIG BUGS
### Memory leaks
    - seems to be mostly at beggining

## Scratch Pad
- Now its time to be able to add activities to other activities
    - add it to the editmanager
        - its there, now connect bound variable to it
        
- Home screen
    - favorites: Home subActivities
    
- make main activityview (top of find activityView)
    - wait after start
    - next
    - parent 
    - subclasses

- make edit/add view
    - Views I need
        - Activity Class
            - edit / add / detail
                - add classes where necessary
                - make add view flow
    
    


- make workable state for my burger/quick breakfast recepie
    - UI for Active activities
        - higher nodes!!!
        - number of completions

# Clean up
##unit tests

# Permenant notes
## UI
UI is a bit of a challenge due to its tree like nature, starting out with 
simple MVP like UI so I can iterate

### UI watch
can I do edits and creation on the watch
research apple watch background states

## Happy on complete!
consider how to reward user for finishing tasks
