# WorkingArticle
1% a day is all you need

an app to make and use timed todo list and recepies

## BIG BUGS
### Memory leaks
    - seems to be mostly at beggining

## Scratch Pad
- When home only show its sublists
    - 
- make main activityview (top of find activityView)
    - wait after start
    - next
    - parent 
    - subclasses

- Have Find Activity View, use as HomeView

- make edit/add view
    - Views I need
        - Activity Class
            - edit / add / detail
            - start activity
            
            
            
            
            
    - find view
        - document browser
        - search functionality
            - shows list 
            
    - edit view
    - make add view flow
    


- make workable state for my burger/quick breakfast recepie
    - UI for Active activities
        - higher nodes!!!
        - number of completions

# Clean up
##unit tests

# Permenant notes
## UI
UI is a bit of a challenge due to its tree like nature, starting out with 
simple MVP like UI so I can iterate

### UI watch
can I do edits and creation on the watch
research apple watch background states

## Happy on complete!
consider how to reward user for finishing tasks
