# WorkingArticle
1% a day is all you need

an app to make and use timed todo list and recepies

## BIG BUGS
### Memory leaks
    - seems to be mostly at beggining

## Scratch Pad


    
- make workable state for my burger/quick breakfast recepie
    - UI for Active activities
        - higher nodes!!!
        - number of completions

# Clean up

##unit tests

# Permenant notes
## UI
UI is a bit of a challenge due to its tree like nature, starting out with 
simple MVP like UI so I can iterate

### UI watch
can I do edits and creation on the watch
research apple watch background states

## Happy on complete!
consider how to reward user for finishing tasks
